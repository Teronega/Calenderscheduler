## Description
Objective is to take the starter code & create a functional calendar application.
The calandar will represent a typical workday of 9am-5pm and appear dynamically on the HTML and CSS
via jQuery. This calender will feature a responsive interface that saves events to localstorage.
Once closed and re-opened, these events will be saved unless otherwise changed again.
Event times are color-coded accordingly to time.
